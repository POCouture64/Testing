## Testing

I will use this document to work on my SIMOA code since I am having trouble with it currently in the existing format. In this way I can mess around with this code and not be worried about it impacting my original data and now that I know what I want to do for my clusters it is easier for me to manipulate the variables in a manner that will set me up for success later.

## Loading the Data

```{r}
#| label: Loading the Data
######
# In this section I will load in the dataset I want to use and name it "SIMOA" 
# so it is easier to call back on later and i know that this is my original datset.
######

library(readr)
SIMOA <- read_csv("SIMOA Report.csv")
View(SIMOA)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
