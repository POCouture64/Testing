# Testing
This is the workflow I will use to remake my SIMOA data analysis. The current way I did it was not correct and is complicating my analyses. I will remake the main body of the analysis including the group differences and ensure the numbers are the same, from there I will start the imp with the new classification which could help with my clusters/RFM
